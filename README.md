# RL
A virtual pet game with a reinforcement learning algorithm.

This game revolves around caring for a virtual dog, 
with various actions affecting the dog's health, happiness, hunger, and 
tiredness. The dog ages based on the number of actions performed, and 
managing its needs effectively is key to success. Let's break down the 
dynamics and actions of the game:

Game Dynamics:
Age and Life Stages: The dog's age increases with each action taken. 
It progresses through life stages: puppy, adult, senior, and elderly. 
Different stages may have different needs and capabilities.

Health, Hunger, Happiness, and Tiredness: These are the primary attributes 
you need to manage. Failing to maintain these can lead to the dog's health 
decline, impacting the game's outcome.

Money Management: Players start with a set amount of money used to buy food
and potentially for other expenses.

Hidden Attributes: Cleanliness and social need are hidden but impact the 
dog's overall well-being.

Random Events: Events such as vet visits or flea infestations occur randomly,
requiring player decisions that impact the dog's health and happiness.

Tricks and Shows: Players can teach the dog tricks, which help it win in 
shows, earning money.

Actions and Their Effects:
Feed: Decreases hunger but costs money. Neglecting to feed increases hunger
and can impact health.

Walk: Decreases tiredness, increases happiness, and hunger. Also affects 
cleanliness and has a chance to improve social needs. Neglecting walks can 
affect happiness and health.

Play: Increases happiness but also increases hunger and tiredness. 
Neglecting play can lead to decreased happiness.

Sleep: Decreases tiredness and increases hunger slightly. Regular sleep is 
crucial for maintaining health.

Groom: Increases cleanliness but might decrease happiness as some dogs 
dislike grooming.

Socialise: Increases social needs and happiness but can increase tiredness
and hunger.

Administer Flea Treatment: Necessary when the dog has fleas; affects 
happiness.

Teach Trick: Opportunity to teach the dog new tricks, with a higher success
rate in puppies. Tricks are crucial for winning in shows.

Participate in Show: If the dog knows tricks, it can participate in shows 
to win money.

Event Dynamics:

Vet Visit: Triggered randomly. Choosing to visit the vet can improve health
if the dog is unwell but may decrease happiness due to stress.

Sudden Illness: Requires a decision to visit the vet or not, impacting 
health and happiness based on the dog's actual condition.

Flea Event: Requires administering flea treatment multiple times, 
affecting the dog's happiness.

Strategy for Success:

Balance Needs: Regularly feeding, walking, playing with, and grooming the 
dog is essential to keep its attributes balanced.

Save and Earn Money: Manage your funds wisely. Winning shows can be a good
source of income.

Age and Trick Learning: Focus on teaching tricks when the dog is young 
(puppy or adult stage) for a higher success rate.

Participate in Shows: Once the dog has learned tricks, regularly participate
in shows to earn money.

Monitor Hidden Attributes: Although cleanliness and social needs are hidden, 
their effects on happiness and health are significant. Regular grooming and
socializing are important.

The game combines resource management, strategic planning, and 
decision-making, making it both challenging and engaging. Balancing the 
dog's various needs, responding appropriately to random events, and making
strategic choices about spending money and teaching tricks are key to 
ensuring the dog's long and happy life.
